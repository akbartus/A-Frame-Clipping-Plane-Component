# A-Frame-Clipping-Plane-Component
<img src="img/screenshot.gif" title="Video screen capture" alt="Video screen capture" height="400">

### **Description / Rationale**
This is an A-Frame component, which demonstrates clipping planes. It was developed based on corresponding <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_clipping.html">example</a> provided by Three.js library. However it also has some distinguishing features: 
* Clipping direction option.
* Applying clipping in relation to GLTF files and other entity types.
* Manipulating clipping plane using mouse scroll event or touchmove event
* Enabling double-sided meshes.     

### **Instructions**
In order to use the component attach "clipping-plane" to an entity. The component has the following attributes: 
* <b>clippingDirection: { type: 'string', default: 'top-to-bottom' }</b> - Direction of the clipping plane or from where it should move. Has the following options: "top-to-bottom" (on Y-axis), "bottom-to-top" (on Y-axis), "front-to-back" (on Z-axis), "back-to-front" (on Z-axis), "left-to-right" (on X-axis), "right-to-left" (on X-axis).  
* <b>materialSide: { type: 'boolean' }</b> - Whether mesh should have double sided material.
* <b>planeConstant: { type: 'float', default: 2.0 }</b> // Original clipping plane locaion on X or Y or Z axis depending on clipping plane direction. It is from where it starts.
* <b>minScrollValue: { type: 'float', default: -2.0 }</b> - Minimal value beyond which clipping plane will not go. X or Y or Z axis depending on clipping plane direction.
* <b>maxScrollValue: { type: 'float', default: 2.0 }</b> - Maximal value beyond which clipping plane will not go. X or Y or Z axis depending on clipping plane direction.
* <b>mouseScrollSpeed: { type: 'float', default: 0.0005 }</b> - Mouse scrolling speed or delta. 
* <b>touchScrollSpeed: { type: 'float', default: 0.01 }</b> - Touch based scrolling speed or delta.

The code below shows the sample implementation of the component. Please make sure to add <a-camera></a-camera> to enable scrolling/touch move events:

            geometry="primitive: box" position="3 1 0" scale="1 1 1"></a-entity>
        <a-entity id="model2" class="clickable" clipping-plane="clippingDirection: right-to-left; materialSide: true;"
            geometry="primitive: box" position="-2 1 0"></a-entity>
        <a-plane position="0 0 -1" rotation="-90 0 0" width="8" height="8" color="#a4b6c9"
            shadow="receive: true"></a-plane>
        <a-camera position="0 2 2.5"></a-camera> <!-- Required for click events -->
        <a-sky color="#dfdfdf"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
</body>

```
Clipping plane gets activated after clicking on GTLF/entity. Then use mouse scroller. For touch based devices, first touch the GLTF and then touch and move up or down (drag).

### **Tech Stack**
The project is powered by AFrame and Three.js. The models used in the example were taken from <a href="[https://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/models/gltf)">Three.js library</a>.
